In the realm of hiring and talent acquisition, understanding a candidate's personality
traits is essential for determining their compatibility with a company's culture and job
requirements. As reported by the New York Times, the psychometrics field is a $2
billion dollar industry with over 2000 personality tests on the market currently. The
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most widely recognised framework
for assessing personality types in the world, with more than 3.5 million assessments
administered annually. It is used in 26 countries to assess employees, students,
soldiers and potential marriage partners. This project aims to develop a predictive
model that can accurately determine a person's MBTI based on their texts posted on
social media platforms. The project aims to develop a tool for companies to quickly
gain insight into the personalities of their potential hires to make informed candidate
selection decisions, maximise the potential of their employees and better manage the
culture of the firm.


Hiring the right candidates is a of paramount importance to organisational success.
Traditional hiring methods, such as resumes reviews and job interviews, provide
limited insights into a candidate's personality. This could result in personality conflicts
with the company's culture upon hiring. Social media generally serve as a reflection of
an individual's authentic thoughts, values and communication style. Hence, by
analysing their social media activity, hiring managers can gain a deeper understanding
of their personality traits and make applicant evaluations more precise, improve
assessments of cultural fit, and ultimately increase the likelihood of successful and
fulfilling employee-company matches.


In this project, I have built a machine learning model that takes in text as input and
produces a prediction of the MBTI personality type of the user of said text as output.
